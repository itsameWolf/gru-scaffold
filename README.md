# GRU

GRU (from Italian meaning crane) is a prototype 3D printing device capable of printing endlessly in along the Z axis by climbing on the object it is printing once it has reached the end of its work area.

This is an inherently limited device, which has been tested only in a laboratory setting to demonstrate the concept of a climbing 3D printer. While the idea will be developed further, this hardware implementation has achieved its purpose and will not see any further developments. If you decide to build this device be ready for extensive tinkering.
